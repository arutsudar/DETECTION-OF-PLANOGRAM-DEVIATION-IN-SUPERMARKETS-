PROBLEM DEFINITION

To propose an image processing technique for the          detection of planogram deviation in super markets.


MOTIVATION


Product positioning is of great importance in supermarkets
to increase sales and profits and to provide convenient
means of shopping to the customers. Currently,
the planogram matching control of products is conducted
manually and causes time loss. With this project we aim for
the automation of planogram compliance control.


OBJECTIVE

In our project our main aim is detection of planogram deviation. Each time a sample image is given the features are extracted and the object detection is done. If the arrangement is correct then there is no misplaced object else the misplaced object is detected by indicating it with a rectangular box
